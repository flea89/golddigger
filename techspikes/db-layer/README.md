# What I've tried so far
- I managed to connect the app to Firestore and Firestore emulator using Firestore admin SDK

- Setup a Firestore in mongodb mode
    - Failed to connect from Prisma

- Done a bit of research and it seems like Prisma woulnd't be able to connect neither to Firestore nor DocumentDB ( haven't tried super hard :P)
  But from some issues I could infer it's not something that is supported

# TODO
- Try mongo Atlas
